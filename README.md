# Vue Prism Editor - experimental

what if prismjs was an editor?

> live demo: [prism-editor.netlify.com](https://prism-editor.netlify.com/)

## Features

- Code Editing ^^
- Syntax highlighting
- Undo / Redo
- Copy / Paste
- The spaces/tabs of the previous line is preserved when a new line is added
- Works on mobile (thanks to contenteditable)
- Resize to parent width and height <sup>new</sup>
- Support for line numbers <sup style="color:red">new</sup>
- Support for autosizing the editor <sup>new</sup>
- Autostyling the linenumbers(optional) <sup>new</sup>

## Use Case

The goal of this project is to have a simple code editor. You can use to make small changes of some content or you just need a textarea with syntax highlighting. That's what it's good for. If you need an advanced code editor use Codemirror or Monaco Editor.

## Usage

TODO

```sh
npm install __TODO__
```

## Dependencies

- [prismjs](https://ghub.io/prismjs): Lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting. A spin-off project from Dabblet.
- [vue](https://ghub.io/vue): Reactive, component-oriented view layer for modern web interfaces.
